Go back into your file `<handle>.md` and add some `MarkDown`. It shall include:
- [x] A level 1 header with your full name.
- [x] A level 2 header with your GitHub handle.
- [ ] An image (of yourself - preferably).
- [ ] A bulleted list of things you are currently working on.
- [ ] A prioritized list of Programming languages and technologies you wanna work with.
- [ ] A link to all your public repositories on GitHub.
- [ ] Your GMail (if you have more, than just the one you'd like to use for sharing documents).
- [ ] A short description of what you dream of working with - two years from now - when you graduate and enter the labour market as a full-fledged, full-time software developer.

As you progress with the items on the list - come back to this issue and check out the items.

When you are all done commit the issue** (try to make the commit message a clever one).

_All_ the time you spend on practicing and learning MarkDown is _never_ wasted. You will be using it for the rest of your career as a developer!
